The files here are :

- BPMN files (edited using Camunda Modeler)
- PNG files (generated from Camunda Modeler)
- JSON files (generated using `fbpmn bpmn2json`)
- TLA+ files (generated using `fbpmn bpmn2tla`)

The BPMN files contain documentation about the origin of the model (when known, please let us now if information is missing).

The TLA+ files generated from the JSON files are in the `models/json-origin` directory.
